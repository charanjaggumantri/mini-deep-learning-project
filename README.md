Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The MNIST dataset is loaded using tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data().
The images are normalized by dividing the pixel values by 255 (scaling them to the range [0, 1]).
The images are flattened from 28x28 pixel arrays to 1D arrays of 784 pixels to feed them into the neural network.
Model Construction:

The model is a simple feedforward neural network with:
Input Layer: A dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
Dropout Layer: A dropout layer with a rate of 0.2 to reduce overfitting.
Output Layer: A dense layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and softmax activation to output probabilities for each class.
Compiling the Model:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss (because labels are integers), and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
Training the Model:

The model is trained for 5 epochs using the training data, and validation is done on the test set (validation_data=(x_test, y_test)).
The training process history (including accuracy and loss over epochs) is saved in the history object.
Model Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on the test data to obtain the test accuracy.
Visualizing Training Progress:

The training and validation accuracy and loss curves are plotted to visually inspect the learning process.
Prediction and Displaying Results:

The model makes predictions on the test set. A sample image from the test set is displayed with the predicted label and the true label.
Saving the Model:

The trained model is saved to a file called mnist_model.h5 for later use or deployment.
